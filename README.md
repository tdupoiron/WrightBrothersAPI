# WrightBrothersAPI
The API is structured to manage a list of planes.

#### - Welcome Aboard!!!
Welcome to the WrightBrothers API project, where we embark on an exciting journey in the world of coding, guided by GitHub Copilot, our trusty navigator much like an airplane's copilot. Imagine yourself as a pilot, akin to the pioneering Wright Brothers, stepping into the cockpit of modern software development. GitHub Copilot, your co-pilot, is there to assist you in navigating the vast and often turbulent skies of coding challenges.

Just as the Wright Brothers revolutionized travel by mastering the skies, GitHub Copilot is set to revolutionize coding by harnessing the power of AI. In this bootcamp, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate GitHub Copilot into your coding practice, allowing it to guide you through complex codebases, offer real-time suggestions, and help troubleshoot tricky segments of code, much like a copilot would assist in navigating difficult flight paths.

As you become more proficient with GitHub Copilot, you'll find it's not just an assistant but a co-creator, propelling your projects forward with the speed and precision that would make the Wright Brothers proud. This project is your runway to mastering this AI-powered tool, helping you soar to new heights in your coding endeavors.

### Welcome aboard, and let's take flight into the future of coding! &#9992;
